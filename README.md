# Swift Data Structures
In an attempt to rekindle my knowledge of data structures and learn some of the intricacies of swift I've decided to reimplement some of my favorites. 

### Binary Search Tree
**9/24/16:** Started out with this classic. Using a generic node in swift gave me some issues but the insert function seems to be working.

### Red Black Tree
To be done.

### AVL Tree
To be done.

### Linked List (single and double)
To be done.

### Vector
To be done.

### Stack / Queue
To be done.

### D-Ary Heap
To be done
